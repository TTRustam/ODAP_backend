#' @param variable character. A scalar with the variable name which is to be graduated. For example `Pop` or `Death`

NOTE, `abridged` will not work if the data_in is in 5-year groups, since we do not know the initial distributions in the abridged ages.

# TR: You'll need to explain this. Note, DemoTools has lt_rule_4m0_D0(), which seems doable
# in our case, with just one more function arg. That would handle deaths, whereas 
# use together with lt_rule_4m0_m0() could help back out Population for infants. This would
# require deaths and exposures being mutually aware when handled, but this should
# be OK if both are available in data_in, which we currently guarantee. So... We
# have all info required to split 0-4 into infants and 1-4.
